# Balance Sheet Project

This is my balance sheet project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built a financial balance sheet that displays company assets, liabilities, and net worth using HTML tables and CSS.

## Project Overview

The Balance Sheet project helped me learn how to create and style tables to present financial data in a clear, organized format. The sheet displays financial information across multiple years, with appropriate styling to highlight the current year's data.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Creating and styling HTML tables for data presentation
- Using CSS pseudo-selectors for targeted styling
- Implementing accessibility features for screen readers
- Styling table headers, rows, and cells consistently
- Using CSS to create a professional financial document
- Adding descriptive tooltips for data clarification
- Creating visual hierarchy in tabular data
- Implementing responsive design for table layouts
- Using CSS grid and flexbox to align table elements

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The HTML structure with tables for assets, liabilities, and net worth
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that styles the tables and implements accessibility features

## Design Elements

The balance sheet features:
- Clean, professional layout for financial data
- Year-by-year comparison across multiple tables
- Highlighted current year data for emphasis
- Tooltips that provide additional context for each item
- Screen reader accessible text that's hidden visually
- Proper table captions and headers for clarity
- Consistent styling across related data elements
- Total rows that stand out from regular data rows
- Color coding to differentiate between data types

This project was particularly useful for learning how to present complex data in a structured format. I gained a deeper understanding of how proper HTML structure and thoughtful CSS styling can make numerical information more accessible and easier to understand.
